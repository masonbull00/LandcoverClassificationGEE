# NellieJuanClasificationGEE
The Google Earth Engine codes I created for creating training data and classifying landcover in the Nellie Juan Watershed.
These are numbered by the order they should be completed in. 
1: establish your training data and create an unsupervised classification to check your interpretation against the computer (This can be done once, or copied and used for each sensor you are using)
2: classify Landsat imagery with you input training data 

There are other optional codes in this repository as well.
Spectral Signature charting allows you to check your training data and classifications for continuity across satellites
Scan Line Correction accounts for scan line failure on Landsat 7 and should be added to codes using Landsat 7 data.
